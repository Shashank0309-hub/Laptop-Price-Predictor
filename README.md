# Laptop-Price-Predictor
I have created this project of Laptop Price Predictor using Python and Streamlit and deployed &amp; hosted on Heroku. Visit the website: https://ssk-laptop-pr-predictor.herokuapp.com/


# Steps -> 
1. Run "movie_recommender_system.ipynb" 
3. You will get 2 main files naming "df.pkl" containing dataframe of dataset of laptops and "pipe.pkl" containing pipe for predicting the prices of laptop based on different values of different attributes.
4. Pip Install Streamlit first for local hosting.
6. Run "app.py" file for model to work and enter the entries for asked attributes and will get the predicted price.
7. Setup Heroku and Upload the project on cloud for Hosting.
